## Preliminary tasks

```{r}
# loading necessary packages
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, tidytext, topicmodels, janitor
)

# reading in the data
reviews <- read_csv(
  file = "data/reviews.csv",
  show_col_types = F
  ) %>% 
  # clean variables names
  clean_names() %>% 
  # select variables of interest and rename them according
  select(
    user_name, 
    review_message = content, 
    rating = score, 
    thumbs_up_count, 
    created_at = at
  )

# tokenize review message
reviews %>% 
  # store output in word variable
  unnest_tokens(
    output = word, 
    input = review_message
    ) %>% 
  # remove stop words
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% 
  # filter obvious words in the word column
  filter(
    !word == "app",
    # also remove rows with numbers
    !str_detect(word, "[0-9]")
    ) -> 
  # assign to tidy_reviews
  tidy_reviews

tidy_reviews %>% 
  count(word, sort = T) %>% 
  head(n = 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(word, n), n, fill = word))+
  geom_col(show.legend = F)+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(
    title = "Most common words in the review messages",
    x = "Word",
    y = "counts"
  )
```
